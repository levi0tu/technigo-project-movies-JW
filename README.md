# Movies

The assignment is to create an app and use API to fetch popular movies. There should be two pages, one with all movies and one for single movie details.

- I started with setting up the API and making sure it was fetched and displayed on the page.
- I used AI to help me understand the links and connections step by step.
- My strategy was to resemble the design of the provided example page.
- If I had more time I would get creative fetching other types of data and creating more pages.
